Waveform Tuner is a simple Renoise tool for tuning single cycle waveforms to C4. This is achieved by taking the length of the sample buffer and adjusting the `Transpose` and `Finetune` parameters such that the wave form will loop at C4. 

As a convenience the `Loop` mode is set to `forward`.

The tool provides an Instrument Box context menu and a Keyboard Shortcut which will tune the currently selected sample.
